# tortoise api
## Compatability
- mrq's tortoise repo: https://git.ecker.tech/mrq/ai-voice-cloning 
- AI Voice Cloning v2 from my github: https://github.com/JarodMica/ai-voice-cloning/releases/tag/v2.0

Just a quick file that I frequently use to make calls to the gradio page, nothing more.  Tortoise still needs to be installed and work separately in order for this module to work. 

As well, you **MUST** make sure that the Results Folder in the Tortoise Settings is an absolute path and not a relative path.  Any absolute path will work as long as it's a valid path.
